      <description>Introduction Probably everyone that has dived into the world of custom mechanical keyboards, learns pretty fast that almost any aspect of a keyboard can be customized. This includes the arrangement of letters on the keyboard, we refer to this as the keyboard layout. There are already plenty of alternative layouts (Dvorak, Colemak, etc.), but often these are based only loosely on letter frequency and hand ergonomics.
The purpose of this post is not to advertise some shiny new layout, but to give people the chance to find an optimal keyboard layout for their own needs.</description>

    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <p>Lately I have become quite interested in garbage collection
    algorithms Since garbage collection massively affects code performance,
    there have been quite elaborate garbage collection algorithms devised in
    the JVM. What initially sparked my interest was the <a
                                                            href="https://github.com/mmtk/mmtk-core">mmtk toolkit</a> and the <a
                                                            href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17175v1">LXR paper</a>.</p>
    <p>I decided to dive deeper into the topic and consulted the Garbage
    Collection Handbook <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
                                                            role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, which gives a very nice and
                                                          structured overview of the basic algorithms and their performance
                                                          characteristics.</p>
    <p>I also went through a few papers related to GC two notable ones: - A
    unified Theory of Garbage Collection <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
                                                        id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, which investigated the
                                                      “dualism” between garbage collection and reference counting - On-the-Fly
                                                      Garbage Collection: An Exercise in Cooperation <a href="#fn3"
                                                                                                        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>,
                                                                                                      which is a short but succinct paper on concurrent garbage collector
                                                                                                      (related to Golang’s GC implementation)</p>
    <p>One of my main goals was to implement a real garbage collector in a
    real interpreter. What I found out is that the PyPy interpreter has been
    adapted to support plugable garbage collectors, hence I decided to
    implement a simple garbage collector in PyPy.</p>
    <h1 id="my-idea">My idea</h1>
    <p>Choose the simplest garbage collection algorithm first, so you can
    familiarize yourself with the code base. From my POV the most basic
    algorithm is the mark-and-sweep garbage collection.</p>
    <p>The algorithm is quite simple: 1. Mark: Traverse the whole object
    graph (<em>tracing</em>) from all root objects and mark every reachable
    object 2. Sweep: Examine every heap object and free object if not marked
    as reachable</p>
    <h1 id="how-it-went">How it went</h1>
    <p>So here’s condensed version of the implementation steps and issues I
    found along the way. Since the PyPy test suite was quite helpful I did
    some kind of TDD for the implementation. There is already a few GC
    implementations in the interpreter and the <code>SemiSpaceGC</code>
    seems to be the simplest one. This gave me a good starting point for the
    mark-and-sweep.</p>
    <h3 id="the-initial-implementation">The initial implementation</h3>
    <p>Starting from what I have seen in <code>SemiSpaceGC</code> I created
    a class that derives from the base classes and added a test</p>
    <p>Unfortunately the <a
                             href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy/commit/95c08cf671a66faaaf2714d66aba8460f94ad5e8">basic
                             setup</a> produced an
                           <code>AttributeError: 'SimpleMarkSweepGC' object has no attribute 'HDR'</code>
                           when executing the tests. I guess the interface in the
                           <code>GCBase</code> could be improved to provide some more guidance on
                           what the interface needs. We will run into some more of that later
                           on.</p>
    <p>The solution was to do what all the other gc implementations are also
    doing, so I looked the semispace gc to find out what to do: Each GC
    class defines a header struct to save info on garbage collection,
    <code>HDR = lltype.Struct('header', ('tid', lltype.Signed))</code> After
    a few more AttributeErrors I ended up with <a
                                                   href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy/commit/95c08cf671a66faaaf2714d66aba8460f94ad5e8#diff-cd6d69f151e7cc01da83fc97cc1207376709999db310b59a0fe6489634f16ad8R12">this
                                                   minimal setup</a></p>
    <p>From inspecting the rest of the gc implementations it seemed that
    <code>malloc_varsize</code> / <code>malloc_fixedsize</code> create new
    objects that are managed by the GC, the <code>collect</code> methods
    runs a major collection of the GC and
    <code>init_gc_object_immortal</code> usually sets a flag for immortal
    objects (<a
                 href="https://github.com/aweltsch/pypy/blob/6acc3aeb7200440c7385a1508dc1ce420c829020/rpython/memory/gctypelayout.py#L453">called
                 from <code>consider_constant</code></a>).</p>
    <h3 id="allocating-memory">Allocating memory</h3>
    <p>Having the basic structure in place, I could implement the first
    version of the GC (I guess you could call it a NoGC <a
                                                            href="https://docs.mmtk.io/portingguide/howto/nogc.html">similar to
                                                            mmtk</a>) that allocates memory via the <code>raw_malloc</code>
                                                          function. Using <code>raw_malloc</code> is in contrast to what the
                                                          semispace GC does since most of the GC implementations in PyPy are using
                                                          arena based allocation. <a
                                                                                      href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy/commit/6acc3aeb7200440c7385a1508dc1ce420c829020">The

                                                                                    basic setup we can finally look into implementing the mark and sweep
                                                                                    phases.</p>
    <h3 id="mark-and-sweep">Mark and sweep</h3>
    <p>We need to track all the objects on the heap and introduce an
    <code>AddressDeque</code> which holds the references for that. (see also
    <code>HybridGC</code> for a similar implementation) Every time we
    allocate we can add the address to our deque and in the sweep phase we
    can iterate through all the references.</p>
    <h4 id="simple-mark-sweep-implementation">Simple mark sweep
      implementation</h4>
    <p>We use DFS to mark surviving objects from the roots. Note: It is
    quite hard to follow where you are dealing with addresses vs pointers vs
    objects in rpython… This is the <a
                                        href="https://github.com/aweltsch/pypy/commit/047510a782504a7fb40906782a346892b76a6f6a">resulting
                                        implementation</a></p>
    <p>Most tests that are failing are related to finalizers / weakrefs /
    collections.</p>
    <h3 id="weak-refs">Weak Refs</h3>
    <p>Weak references are references that don’t affect the “reachability”
    of an object. The weak reference can either be valid (pointed-to object
    is alive) or invalid (pointed-to object has been collected).</p>
    <p>Similar to other implementations <a
                                            href="https://github.com/aweltsch/pypy/commit/0f08fce20f8fcb673726e507c7132a4316dc1a1c">We
                                            maintain list of objects that contain weakrefs</a>. then for each object
                                          that contains a weakref we check if the object it is pointing to
                                          survives. If it does not survive, we invalidate the weakref (setting to
                                          NULL), otherwise we “keep” it.</p>
    <h3 id="finalizers">Finalizers</h3>
    <p>A finalizer is a function that runs when an object is about to be
    collected. In PyPy there’s essentially two types of finalizers: - The
    <code>__del__</code> method (set via
    <code>malloc_fixedsize(..., needs_finalizer=True)</code> - <a
                                                                   href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/discussion/finalizer-order.html">FinalizerQueues</a>
    which have to be explicitly instantiated</p>
    <p>Dealing with finalizers is not straight-forward since finalizers can
    revice objects and you need to be careful with the execution order.</p>
    <p>As in the other GCs we will keep track of both types of finalizers in
    the same queue <code>objects_with_finalizers</code>. Each entry in the
    queue is essentially a pair (object, finalizer_queue_index)
    <strong>del</strong> method gets index -1, finalier queues get a proper
    index.</p>
    <p>We need to sweep before executing the finalizers, otherwise a
    finalizer might introduce new objects that are <em>not</em> marked as
    surviving by default The resulting code is <a
                                                   href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy/commit/2c76815c8a90ddbe189de3de612902c531765783">part
                                                   of this commit</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="the-remaining-test-cases">The remaining test cases</h3>
    <p>The remaining test cases were all related to starting a collection
    while another collection is already going on (e.g. via the infamous
    finalizers…)</p>

                                                       a lock</a> (in this case a simple variable since the implementation is
                                                     not concurrent) so that no collection can happen while another
                                                     collection is taking place.</p>
    <h1 id="learnings">Learnings</h1>
    <p>At the end of the day the Mark &amp; Sweep algorithm is not a complex
    algorithm, but implementing it in a real codebase was more challenging
    than expected since I had to dive deep into the inner workings of the
    PyPy interpreter and RPython. Thankfully the PyPy repsoitory contains a
    great test-suite to validate the implementation.</p>
    <p>Finalizers make your life harder (at least with regards to GC) since
    finalizers can e.g. revive objects, so extra steps need to be taken
    before freeing memory. There’s no finalizers in Golang or Java (at least
    since Jav SE9, for a good explanation why that’s the case read the
    deprecation notice for the <a
                                   href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#finalize--"><code>Object.finalize</code>
                                   method</a>)</p>
    <p>It was quite fascinating to dive deeper into the implementation of
    PyPy and to look into the usage of RPython as a low-level implementation
    language. I’m quite interested in building a small interpreter for some
    toy language to play around with RPython it a little more.</p>
    <p>My next GC project will probably be a compacting collector.</p>

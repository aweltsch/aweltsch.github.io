    <h1>MATH + PROGRAMMING</h1>
    <p>
      Hi there! My Name is <em>Andre Weltsch</em> and I am a mathematician with a strong interest in computer science and programming.
      I am currently employed as Senior Software Engineer at Zalando SE in Germany.
      I have been employed in the software industry for more than 10 years now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now I'm mostly working with Kotlin &amp Ktor, as well as frontend technologies like React and TypeScript.
      I also have a lot of experience with Java and Spring Boot for webservice development.
    </p>
    <p>
    My main areas of interest include:
    <ul>
      <li>Distributed Systems and Databases</li>
      <li>Software Architecture</li>
      <li>Operations Research and Graph Theory</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Master's Degree in Mathematics (2018, TU-Berlin)</h3>
    <h4>Master's Thesis: <a href="/static/masters-thesis.pdf">Fast Approximation of Equations of transient Gasflow</a></h4>
    <p>The thesis compares different algorithms to approximate time-dependent gas flow in natural gas networks. I present different linearizations of the nonlinear gas flow equations and evalute the model performances.</p>
    <h3>Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics (2016, TU-Berlin)</h3>
    <h4>Bachelors's Thesis: <a href="/static/bachelors-thesis.pdf">Algorithmic testing of equivalence of polynomials to the determinant</a></h4>
    <p>The thesis gives a detailed description and analysis of a randomized algorithm from "Affine Projections of polynomials" (Kayal, 2012) which can be used to solve the equivalence problem for the determinant polynomial in polynomial time.</p>
